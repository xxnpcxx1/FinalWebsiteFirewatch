  <br> Firewatch is a game where you play as the character, Henry, who is working at a firewatch post for the first time after deciding he needed to pivot in life. While you play the game you get to experience what it's like to be all alone in the forest while you communicate to another person, via walkie talkie, working in a firewatch post. As you go through the weeks you start to realize you may not be as alone as you thought you were.
