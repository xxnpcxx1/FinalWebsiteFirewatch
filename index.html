  <p> Firewatch is a game where you play as the character, Henry, who is working at a firewatch post for the first time after 
    deciding he needed to pivot in life. While you play the game you get to experience what it's like to be all alone in the forest 
    while you communicate with someone, via walkie talkie, working in another firewatch post. As you go through the weeks you start to
    realize you may not be as alone as you thought you were... </p>

    <p> I played this game over the Summer last year for the first time because I was bored and it was free with my Xbox Game Pass.
    I was immediatly hooked into the game becase of the way the game was able to make me feel immersed in the enviornment. The game is
      designed in a way that has you make desicions on what to say and do in the game which help add to the immersion. Here are some images
      of what that could look like.
